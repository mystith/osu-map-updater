# osu-map-updater
a tool that downloads recent osu! maps you're missing so you don't have to do it by hand

uses circlehelper, a library i wrote to parse various osu files (.db, .osu, .osr). it's unfinished but can be seen at https://github.com/mystith/RecordTheBeat/tree/master/RecordTheBeat/CircleHelper until I give it its own repo
